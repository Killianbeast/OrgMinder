## OrgMinder
OrgMinder is a web application designed to schedule events, manage attendance, and keep users in touch in an organization. Users can create different events, keep track of attendance, as well as curate a roster of organization members.

## Pre-Requirements
OrgMinder runs on the Python framework Flask. 
To run the webserver in the current state, you must create a [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
After creating the Virtual Environment, install Flask within it. <br>
```$ pip install Flask```<br>
After Flask is installed, run the `main.py` file in the main directory
